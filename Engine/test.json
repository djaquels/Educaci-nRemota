A study of limits and continuity in multivariable calculus yields many counterintuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions.: 19–22 For example, there are scalar functions of two variables with points in their domain which give different limits when approached along different paths. E.g., the function"},{"https://cty.jhu.edu/online/courses/mathematics/multivariable_calculus.html":"Course Description. Description. Multivariable Calculus is an online and individually-paced course that covers all topics in JHU's undergraduate Calculus III: Calculus of Several Variables course. In this course, students will extend what was learned in AB & BC Calculus and learn about the subtleties, applications, and beauty of limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration in higher ..."},{"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/43290/references-for-multivariable-calculus":"Due to my ignorance, I find that most of the references for mathematical analysis (real analysis or advanced calculus) I have read do not talk much about the \"multivariate calculus\". After dealing with the single variable calculus theoretically, it usually directly goes to the topic of measure theory."},{"https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-calculus/reviews":"I couldn't take calculus at university and this course offered me an opportunity to cover most of the topics in single variable calculus. Its tough, well taught, the staff is helpful and questions are great.
